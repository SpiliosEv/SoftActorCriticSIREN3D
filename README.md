### **Soft Actor Critic for 3D Continuous Motion Control with Sinusoidal Representation Networks for Value function approximation in Wireless Autonomous Networks**


This is one of the algorithms implemented for the paper entitled "Deep Actor-Critic for Continuous 3D Motion Control for Mobile Relay Networks"  in PyTorch. The paper is submitted to ICASSP 2022
The Environment.py and the helper_functions.py files are implemented based on code from Anastasios Dimas
